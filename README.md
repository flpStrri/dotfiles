# Dotfiles
_My personal one line command setup for Python development in Mac OS._

> Warning: If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, update the `.gitconfig` and remove things you don’t want or need.
**Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails.**

It can be installed by running in a clean Mac OS install:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://git.io/JU2ho)"
```
> The short URL expands to GitHub-hosted `install.sh`, which can be easily audited.

To update, cd into your local dotfiles repository and pull from master HEAD using `git pull`
