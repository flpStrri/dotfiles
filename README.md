# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles managed with [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) for a productive development environment on macOS.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Review the code before installing. Fork the repository and modify the `.gitconfig` and other files to match your preferences. Don't blindly use these settings unless you understand what they do.

## One-line Install
```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://git.io/JU2ho)"
```
